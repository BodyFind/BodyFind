{"google":"UA-548504-103","body":"# Welcome to BodyFind Pages.\r\n\r\nThousands of bodies are being buried without identification after the Haiti Earth Quake that occurred on the 12th January 2010. We need a system that will allow relief agencies and special trained teams to go in and identify each body, record images, where the person died, take DNA samples and mark the body. Hopefully the location of burial will also be recorded.\r\n\r\nPeople who have lost loved ones can then try and identify their relatives and friends and get closure, knowing that their friends or relatives were found and where they were buried.\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a new project to create the following:\r\n\r\n* Website to manage the identification of the victims of a disaster\r\n* Section for people to identify the victims from photographs based on a search criteria and geographic locations\r\n* Section for aid workers and rescuers to input data\r\n* Cross platform app to take photos and upload information IE Geotagging\r\n\r\n##What we need\r\n\r\nTeam Members to work on various sections of the system.\r\n\r\n* Software Project Managers\r\n* Main website for identification http://www.bodyfind.com\r\n* Website for the input of data via mobile cell phone\r\n** iPhone App Development Team\r\n** Android App Development Team\r\n* Financial Team to manage donations.
